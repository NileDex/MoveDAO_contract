Understanding the DAO Proposal System in Move
This Move module (proposal.move) is part of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) system that handles proposal creation, voting, and management. Here's a simple explanation:

Main Components
Proposal Lifecycle:

Proposals can be in different states: Draft (0), Active (1), Passed (2), Rejected (3), or Executed (4)

Voting System:

Members can vote Yes (1) or No (2) on proposals

Voting has specific time windows (start and end times)

Key Functions
Creating Proposals:

Only council members can create proposals

Each proposal has a title, description, and voting duration

New proposals start as "Draft" status

Voting:

Members can vote only during the voting period

Each member can vote only once per proposal

Votes are counted as Yes or No

Finalizing Results:

After voting ends, proposals are automatically marked as Passed (if more Yes votes) or Rejected

Technical Details
All proposals are stored in a global DaoProposals structure

Events are emitted when important actions happen (like proposal creation)

Various checks ensure only valid actions can be performed (right permissions, timing, etc.)

Example Flow
Council member creates a proposal (status: Draft)

Voting period begins automatically (status becomes Active)

Other members vote Yes or No during the voting period

After voting ends, the proposal is automatically marked Passed or Rejected

This system provides a basic framework for DAO governance where members can propose ideas and collectively decide on them through voting.
