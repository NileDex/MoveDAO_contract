# 🌟 MoveDAO Simple User Guide

*A beginner-friendly guide to participating in DAOs*

## 🤔 What is MoveDAO?

Think of MoveDAO like a **digital club** where members vote on decisions together. Instead of having a single boss, everyone gets a say in how things work. The more you participate, the more rewards you can earn!

## 🎯 What Can I Do Here?

### 🏠 **Join a Community (DAO)**
- Find a DAO you like (maybe about gaming, art, or investing)
- Pay a small fee to join (like a membership fee)
- Become part of the community instantly!

### 💰 **Stake Your Tokens**
- **What it means**: Lock up some of your tokens to show you're committed
- **Why do it**: Get voting power and earn rewards
- **Think of it like**: Putting money in a savings account that also gives you a voice

### 🗳️ **Vote on Important Decisions**
- Members create proposals (ideas for the community)
- You vote YES, NO, or ABSTAIN (neutral)
- Your vote counts more if you've staked more tokens
- **Example votes**: "Should we fund a new project?" or "Should we change the rules?"

### 🎁 **Earn Rewards**
You can earn tokens by:
- **Voting** → Get paid for participating
- **Creating good proposals** → Bonus for contributing ideas
- **Staking tokens** → Earn interest like a savings account
- **Successful proposals** → Extra bonus if your idea gets approved

### 🚀 **Buy New Tokens Early**
- Some DAOs launch new cryptocurrency tokens
- Members get early access at discounted prices
- It's like getting concert tickets before they go on sale to everyone

Sometimes DAOs create brand new tokens (like new cryptocurrencies). Members get special access to buy these tokens before anyone else!

### How It Works:
1. **Whitelist Phase** 📝
   - Sign up to be eligible
   - Get assigned a tier (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
   - Higher tiers = better benefits

   - Get discounted prices
   - Limited quantities per person

3. **Public Sale Phase** 🌍
   - Open to all DAO members
   - Regular prices
   - First-come, first-served

4. **Token Delivery** 📦
   - Some tokens unlock immediately
   - Others unlock gradually over time (vesting)
   - Claim your tokens when they're ready!

### Tier Benefits:
- **🥉 Bronze**: Basic allocation, 20% unlock immediately
- **🥈 Silver**: More allocation, 30% unlock immediately

It's like being part of a **cooperative business** where:
- Everyone owns a piece
- Everyone gets a vote
- Everyone shares in the profits
- Everyone helps make it successful

**Welcome to the future of community-owned organizations! 🚀**
