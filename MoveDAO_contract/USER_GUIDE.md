## üèõÔ∏è **Joining a DAO**

### **How to Join**
```move
// Function: membership::join()
membership::join(account: &signer, dao_addr: address)
```

**What you need:**
- An Aptos wallet with APT tokens
- The DAO's contract address
- Minimum staking requirement (varies by DAO)

**Steps:**
1. Ensure you have sufficient APT tokens
2. Call the `join` function with the DAO address
3. You'll automatically become a member if requirements are met

**Benefits of membership:**
- ‚úÖ Voting rights on proposals
- ‚úÖ Ability to create proposals
- ‚úÖ Eligibility for rewards
- ‚úÖ Access to exclusive launchpads
- ‚úÖ Community governance participation

### **Leaving a DAO**
```move
// Function: membership::leave()
membership::leave(account: &signer, dao_addr: address)
```

**Important notes:**
- You must unstake all tokens first
- Any pending rewards will be forfeited
- You lose all voting rights immediately

## üí∞ **Staking & Voting Power**

### **Staking Tokens**
```move
// Function: staking::stake()
staking::stake(account: &signer, dao_addr: address, amount: u64)
```

**How staking works:**
- Stake APT tokens to gain voting power
- 1 staked APT = 1 vote weight
- Staked tokens are locked but earn rewards
- Higher stake = more influence in governance

**Benefits of staking:**
- üó≥Ô∏è **Voting Power**: Influence DAO decisions
- üíé **Staking Rewards**: Earn passive income
- üéØ **Proposal Rights**: Create governance proposals
- üöÄ **Launchpad Access**: Priority in token sales

### **Unstaking Tokens**
```move
// Function: staking::unstake()
staking::unstake(account: &signer, dao_addr: address, amount: u64)
```

**Unstaking rules:**
- Can unstake partial amounts
- Reduces your voting power proportionally
- May have cooldown periods (DAO-specific)
- Affects your reward eligibility

### **Viewing Your Stake**
```move
// View function: staking::get_staked_balance()
staking::get_staked_balance(user_addr: address): u64
```

---

## üó≥Ô∏è **Governance Participation**

### **Viewing Proposals**
```move
// View function: proposal::get_proposal()
proposal::get_proposal(dao_addr: address, proposal_id: u64): Proposal
```

**Proposal information includes:**
- Title and description
- Current vote counts (Yes/No/Abstain)
- Voting period start/end times
- Execution window
- Current status

### **Voting on Proposals**
```move
// Function: proposal::cast_vote()
proposal::cast_vote(
    account: &signer,
    dao_addr: address,
    proposal_id: u64,
    vote_type: VoteType,    // Yes, No, or Abstain
    weight: u64             // Amount of voting power to use
)
```

**Voting rules:**
- Must be a DAO member
- Can only vote during active voting period
- Vote weight limited by your staking power
- Cannot change vote once cast
- Earn rewards for participating

**Vote types:**
- **Yes**: Support the proposal
- **No**: Oppose the proposal  
- **Abstain**: Neutral participation (still earns rewards)

### **Creating Proposals**
```move
// Function: proposal::create_proposal()
proposal::create_proposal(
    account: &signer,
    dao_addr: address,
    title: string::String,
    description: string::String,
    execution_window: u64
)
```

**Requirements to create proposals:**
- Must be a DAO member
- Must have minimum staking amount
- Title: 3-100 characters
- Description: 10-2000 characters
- Reasonable execution window

**Proposal lifecycle:**
1. **Draft**: Proposal created, not yet active
2. **Active**: Voting period open
3. **Passed/Rejected**: Based on vote results
4. **Executed**: Successful proposals implemented
5. **Cancelled**: Can be cancelled by creator or admin
